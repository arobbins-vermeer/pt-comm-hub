This is a starter template for a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) blog.

Differences from Next.js tutorial blog are:
-- Routes are category/id
-- You can show and hide posts by category

To get started, simply create a folder under /posts. The name of this folder is the "category".

Inside the category folder, create relevant articles via Markdown.

Update /lib/posts.js with the new category.

And viola! You have a blog you can add/remove/edit categories and files with.
