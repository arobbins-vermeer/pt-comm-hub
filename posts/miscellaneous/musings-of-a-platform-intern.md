I cannot say enough positive things about my experiences at Vermeer --- it has truly been an incredible summer! With that in mind though, there are some things I have learned. Such as giving yourself time and space to learn (luckily my supervisor was very good at this, even if *I* wasn't).

Also: use cases, use cases, use cases! I have mis-stepped a couple times not having taken enough time to think through not just who is using a system but how they will be using it. While these are ideas hammered into us through class, until you sit in the real world and that lack of planning becomes very apparent as it causes unnecessary headache, that is when the lesson contents really solidify. 

These are but a couple of my learning opportunities here at Vermeer, and what I have gained from this experience will continue to help me both throughout the upcoming school year and well into the future. 

Here's to a great internship and a start to something even greater!!
